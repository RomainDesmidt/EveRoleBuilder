goal: online skill planner using different eve api. need to store user_id, password
unlike evemon or equivalent, it aims to regroup all your character and give them roles depending on their skills to know at once which of your character can do what, useful in wh
prolly can do the same for corp/ alliance?

-background jobs, to pull information from api, skill, skill in training, belongs to corp

-parse from xml

-export as xml, probably work as json (to build a to train list with existing limitation)

-devise


TARGET:
Eve Player with a few toons
Corporation or FC

PAIN:
Cant know who can do what easily, most often than not tools make you able to see what skills
what character have but then you have to go one by one which is kinda annoying

SOLUTION:
have your character showing their roles be it custom roles (created by users) or existing one (created with the app)
all character visible at once

ANGLE:
Unlike EveMON which is used for a person on his own characters, the tools should be able to make use of player group, corp, alliance, coalition
Need to show at once who can do what
